What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Its simply a way of writing code. Some rules that we follow--there are other ways as well like, functional programing,
    procedural programing.
    There are four main pillars of OOP:
    1) Inheritance
    2) Polymorphism
    3) Abstraction
    4) Encapsulation

 Why should we learn OOP:
    1) Code re usability.
    2) Its easier to write large amounts of code.
    3) Sharing code with others become easier.
    4) Security of the code is increased.
    5) Changing code becomes easier.
Objects:
    An object is something that we can physically touch. Everything around us like chair, tables, pc, etc bed are all objects.
    We can easily represent these objects inside our computers by telling the computer how the object(s) look and behave.
Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String Class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside the computer is processed in
    this form. String is the most widely used class in Java.
Creating Objects for String class:
    1) length() 2) isEmpty() 3)
