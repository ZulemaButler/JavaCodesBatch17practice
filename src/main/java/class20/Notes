MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same methods n parent and child class. We call it method Overriding.
Why should we learn a bout Overriding:
    Method Overriding gives us a lot of flexibility for example, if we don't like a method from the parent class we can
    override it/change it.

Syntax;
    class Parent{

    void eat(){
    sout "Fish"
    }
    }
    class Child extends Parent{
    void eat()
    sout "Chicken"
    }
    }
