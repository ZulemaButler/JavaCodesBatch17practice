Collections Framework:
    Its a collection of classed and interface which help us build dynamic programs which are capable of handling large
    amounts of data.
Why should we learn about Collections Framework?
    Arrays are not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible.
    1) They are fixed in size.
    2) No ready made methods we have to create our own.

ArrayList:
    Better version of Arrays. It is also index based. Its dynamic we don't to provide the size beforehand and it contains
    a lot of methods to manipulate the data inside it.
Syntax:
    For Arrays we used this syntax
    DataType nameForArray=new Datatype [size]
    String [] arr=new String[5];

    Array<DataType> nameForArrayList=new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();

Methods From ArrayList:
    Size()=> Number of elements.
    add(element)=> adds new element to the arrayList
    get(Index)=> Returns the element on specified index.
    remove(index)=> removes the element on the specified index
    remove(element)=> removes the element from the arrayList
    indexOf(element) => Returns the index of the element.
    Contains(Element) => returns true if element is present otherwise false
