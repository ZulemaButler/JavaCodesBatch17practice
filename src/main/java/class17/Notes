Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another class except private memebers
    and constructors.  We use extend keyword.
Why should we learn about Inheritance:
    1) Faster development
    2) Saves memory
Syntax:
     class parent{

     }
     class child extends Parent{

     }
Rules:
    1) Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also not available for child classes directly.
Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single
       -Single Inheritance: Only one parent and only one child (Not very common)
    2) Hierarchical
       -Hierarchical: One parent multiple children.
    3) Multilevel
        -Multilevel: multilevel inheritance happens when a class c inherits from B and B inherits
    4) Hybrid
        -Hybrid: is a mixture of Hierarchical and Multilevel
    5) Multiple
        -Multiple: Multiple parent classes and one child class (its not supported by Java)
What is Diamond problem in OOP?
    The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and a further class D
         inherits from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
         and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
