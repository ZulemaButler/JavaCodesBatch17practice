What is Object oriented program(OOP)
    Its simply a way of writing code. Some rules that we follow. They're other ways as well like functional programming ,
    procedural programming. There are four main pillars of OOP--1)inheritance 2)Polymorphism 3)Abstraction 4)Encapsulation.
Why should we learn OOP:
    1)Code re-usability
    2)Its easier to write large amounts of code.
    3)sharing code with others become easier.
    4)Security of the code is increased.
    5)Changing code becomes easier.
Object:
    An object is something that we can physically touch and see.Everything around us like chairs, tables, etc. They are all objects
    We can easily represent these objects look like and how it behaves.

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String class:
    A string class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers is processed
     in this form. Sting is most widely used class in all Java.
Creating objects from String class
    1)length() 2)isEmpty()
