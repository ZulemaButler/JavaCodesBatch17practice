Method Overloading:
    Method overloading happens when multiple methods with same name, but with different parameters are created.
    1) Different number of parameters for example min (2,3) min(4,5,6)
    2) Different daya type of methods-- print("Java") ,print(12);
    3) Different Sequence/order of parameters print (Java",12), print (12,"Java")
Why should we learn about method overloading:
    1) Cleaner code- reducing clutter
    2) We don't need to come up with a different method names.

    Syntax:
     class Calculator{

        int add(int a,int b){
        return a+b;
        }

        int add(int a,int b,int c){
            return a+b+c;
            }

         double add(double a,double b){
            return a+b;
            }

            long add(long a,long b){
                    return a+b;
                    }

        }

MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverriding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as child class

NOTE:
    Signature of a method:
       method name plus its parameters are called signature of a method.
     Header of a method:
        header of a method include signature plus return type
