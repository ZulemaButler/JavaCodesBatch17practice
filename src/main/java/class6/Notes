Operators:
 Operators are symbols which perform an operation on data. They're many different types of operators in java.

Arithmetic Operators:
    These operators help us perform simple mathematical operations like
    addition  => + int a=10 int b=20 int c=a+b; =>
    Subtraction  =>-
    multiplication => *
    division /
    modulus %

Shorthand Operators:
    They help us perform mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
    add and update the variable   += int a=10 a+20= =>30
    subtract and update the variable -= int a=10 a-=20 =>-10
    multiply and update the variable *= int a=10 a*=20 =>200
    divide and update the variable /= int a=10 a/=20 =>0
    modulus and update the variable %= int a=10 a%=20 =>10

Relational Operators:
    These operators help us compare things.
    == checks if two objects are equal
    != checks if tow objects are not equal
    > greater than
    < less than
    >= greater than equal
    <= less than equal

Logical Operators:
    They help us combine multiple boolean conditions
    ! Not
    || Or
    && And

Increment / Decrement Operators:
++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
-- this will help us decrease the value of variable by one

While Loop checks the condition first then executes the code. Do while on the other hand
executed the code first and then checks the condition. Sometimes when we write the logic using do while
it becomes easier. There are no other differences and reasons to use a do while instead of while.
