String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,B,C), numbers(1,2,3) special characters(!@#$#$)
    in the form of a group. There are many methods already written by java developers that we can just use.
    This is the most widely used class in java
    for example:
    length()
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()
Why we should learn about this class.
    1) Very important for coding question
    2) Most widely used class in all Java
    3) Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.

Method Chaining:
    When multiple methods are being called on the same line is call method chaining
    String class supports method changing. For method changing to work previous method must return the expected
    datatype for the next method.


Note:
Very important for coding questions.
1) If Else
2) Loops
3) Arrays
4) Strings
