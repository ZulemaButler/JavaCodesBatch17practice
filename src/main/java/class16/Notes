Constructors:
    Constructors helps us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way. We can also put any
    piece of code that we want to execute when the object of a class is created.
Why we should use Constructors?
    1) They help us write more secure classes
    2) Cleaner code
    3) More control over the values that we can assign to instance fields.
Syntax:

    1)Usually public access modifier
    2)Same name as class name
    3)No return type, not even void
    4)Parameters
    5)Body of the constructor

Rules:
