Types of variables:
    There are three types of variables--local, instance, and static.


 Local Variables:
    Local variables are the variable which are created/declare inside a block of code. Like if else conditions,
    loop, switch statements, methods are block of code.
Upside:
    They occupy the memory for shortest period of time. As soon as Java is done executing that block of code
    they are removed from the memory.
Downside:
    They can only be accessed within the block of code they are created
****************************************    ***********************************************
Instance Variables:
    Instance variables are the variables which are created outside of the block (if else, switch, loops
    or methods etc.) of the code but inside a class.
Upside:
    They can be accessed any where within that class
Downside:
    They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory as long as
    that object is in the memory weather you use thm or not. Local variables are easy to debug
****************************************    **************************************************
Local vs Instance:
    Whenever it is possible go and create local variables.Only go with instance variables when you can't
    solve a problem with local variables.
****************************************    ***********************************************
Static Variables:
    Static variables are created inside a class but outside of a block of code with a static keyword.
Upside:
    they are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility. We don't even need to create the object
    of that class in which they are created. We can simply write the name of the class and we can access it
Downside:
    Static variables occupy the memory for longest of all. They are created even though you did not create
    any object of the class.
Use of types of local variables:
    Local;
        Whenever we are solving any problem many times we need local variable to temporally store data. In all of those
        cases you should be going with local variables.
