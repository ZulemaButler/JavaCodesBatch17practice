l;.Object oriented programing:
    -Its just a way (Set of rules) of writing code
        It basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easier to change or manage.
         There are other ways like functional programming and procedural programming.
Why we should use OOP?
    -It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
    -It also helps represent the world around us inside computers easily.
    -Changing code becomes easier.
    -Sharing code and collaboration become easier.
Main concepts/ main Pillars of OOP:
    -Classes and objects (Base not consider main pillar)
    -Inheritance
    -Polymorphism
    -Abstraction
    -Encapsulation
Classes and Objects:
    A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/ design that we create before we start building
      the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes to which help us figure out how something looks like
      and they have behaviours/functions which help us understand how something works.
