Logical Operators:
    Logical operators help combine multiple conditions ((boolean values)) on the same line if statements.
    There are three types of logical operators-- NOT(!) or (||) and (&&):

NOT(!):  (this symbol does the opposite condition)

Why should we use NOT operator:
1) It can help us simplified the logic in some of the cases
2) Code readability will increase.

OR(||): (This or that condition--Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way
that as soon as one condition gets true that whole condition will be evaluated to true.

true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
true||true||true=>true

And (&&) Logical and Operator will help us combine conditions in such a way that it will only give us
true if all the conditions are true.

true&&false&&true=>false
true&&true&&true=>true
true && ture && false=> false
