Constructors:
    Constructor helps us build objects from classes easily. They help us give initial values to the instance fields.
    The name of the constructor must be the same as the class name.
    Constructors do not have any return types. Most of the time constructors are public.
    Other than initializing the values we can have whatever type of code inside the constructor that we like--for example
    calling methods,writing if-else etc.

Class ClassName{
String name;

public ClassName(){

}
public ClassName(Sting myName){
name=myName;
}
}
