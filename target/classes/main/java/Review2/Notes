Type Casting:

    Type casting is converting data from one data type to another data type.
    for example we can convert an integer to float or another way around.
    There are two type of type casting: Type casting only works with primitive data stpe
    1) Implicit/Auto/Widening
    2) Explicit/Manual/Narrowing

Example;
int num=(int) 10.5
===================================
If Statements:
    If statements are part of the condition constructs in java. They help us write code that can be executed
    based on a condition.
    There are many variation of "If Statements"
    1) if 2)if else *only 2 possibilities 3)else if *more than two possibilities 4)nested if
Why do we need conditional statements?
    Without the if statements programs will always generate same output no mater what.
Syntax:
    if(THE CONDITION) {
    something that we to execute if condition is true
    }else{
    something that we want to execute if condition is false
    }
Note:
1)Whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if--
conditions always go with els if statements.
2) With primitive data types we can use < > == != etc.
but with non-primitive we have to use equals method.
