Arrays:
    Arrays are data structures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Indexes always start from zero.
Why should we use arrays?
    Arrays help use store and manipulate large amount of data easily with the help of loops. Whenever we have
    more than 3 similar items that we can to store and process together we should always go with arrays.
Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating the arrays--
    Method 1:
    DataType[]nameOfThe Array={element1, element2, element3}
    Method 2
    DataType[] name of The array = new DataType[Size};
Enhanced For Loop;
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through data structures which have multiple items stored insided them.
Why should we use Enhanced for Loop:
   Its simple and easy to understand.
Syntax:
    for (DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName: NameofTheDateStructure){}
Limitations:
    1) Enhanced for loop cant be used to for updating the elements.
    2) Access the elements in the reverse order etc.
Break:
    Break keyword is used in switch cases and statements and with the loops to terminate the loops prematurely.
Why we should use break keyword?
    using break keyword can help us save a lot of processing time and our code can execute faster.
Continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop, once we hit the skip keyword java ignores the rest of
    the code in the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
